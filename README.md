# Four-in-a-row
This is my attempt to write the classic four-in-row game
in the C programming language.

### Initial attempt
Initially there won't be any optimizations as I want to measure the performance
of any optimizations.
The first draft will use a simple mini-max algorithm and the evaluation of the board
will be simple. Future versions will use alpha/beta and have a more sophisticated 
algorithm to evaluate the board.
